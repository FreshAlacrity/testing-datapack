This datapack is just for testing that datapacks are being loaded in correctly/check if the location is correct etc. for troubleshooting purposes - I hope it helps!

It's just so it's very easy to tell when reloads have been completed, how many times the pack has been loaded. This is useful for when you aren't sure if you are putting datapacks in the right location, or if you want a quick template for how to use `tellraw` to do OP commands, incrementing dummy scoreboard objectives, or how to run a function when the pack is loaded in. 

MIT License so please feel free to do what you want with it!
